# isClose is like isEqual, but with a tolerance in case we have problems...
# .Machine

# a is length 1 or b is length 1 or both ...
# if both are not length 1, they have to be the same length ...
# we will return vector of logical (bool) that is the longest length ...
# this will allow it to be natively used in subset notation ... if of vector structure

# this was a bug that came up in the simulations research project with jillian
# took about 4 hours to figure out that this was the problem
# isClose will fix this issue ...

This package provides infrastructure to make text datasets available within R, even when they are too large to store within an R package or are licensed in such a way that prevents them from being included in OSS-licensed packages.
