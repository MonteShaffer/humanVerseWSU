Description: "-- If you can save 5 seconds for 1 million users, that is 50 lifetimes per day. 
    You are saving lives! -Andy Hertzfeld, Apple [ https://youtu.be/WpdhFAKPsT4?t=1060 ] 
    
    Okay, if you do the math of the above quote, it is way off.  But the principle is true!
    
    I spend way too much time manipulating data, reconsidering "how to do that in R again",
and I teach others: undergrad students, grad students, Ph.D.s with a research question various
tricks to speed things up.  To get out of the minutia, so we can focus on the research.

    Manipulating dataframes, doing basic statistics, organizing datasets, performing normalization
procedures on data, dealing with "is-close" issues related to floating-point precision issues.

    My functions are long in name, but readable to most (including managers who may see the function
calls in a succint RMarkdown Latex report).  I listen to those I work with and add functions to
this humanVerse from time to time.  I use hunchBackNotation and Whitesmith indentation.

    I write functions based on a C-based background, and I like to utilize R's vector default
to execute the functions.  Many of my functions on procedural or task based, and merely wrappers 
of common functions for the seasoned R community.  

    Enjoy!
