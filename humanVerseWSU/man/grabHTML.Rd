\description{
This grabs an HTML file (or any web TXT file) and caches locally.
There needs to be a global variable `local.data.path` assigned so
this function understands it is running in a local environment where
it can actually save files.  As opposed to `github.data.path` I can't
source this file in a remote repository if I can't store files there.
