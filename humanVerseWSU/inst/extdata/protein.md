# "protein" data set

<http://www.dm.unibo.it/~simoncin/Protein.html>

The following data, originated by A. Weber and cited in Hand et al. (1994, pp. 297), measure the amount of protein consumed for nine food groups in 25 European countries. The nine food groups are red meat (RedMeat), white meat (WhiteMeat), eggs (Eggs), milk (Milk), fish (Fish), cereal (Cereal), starch (Starch), nuts (Nuts), and fruits and vegetables (FruitVeg). Suppose you want to determine whether national figures in protein consumption can be used to determine certain types or categories of countries; specifically, you want to perform a cluster analysis to determine whether these 25 countries can be formed into groups suggested by the data.
