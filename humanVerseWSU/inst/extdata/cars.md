# "cars" data set

<https://www.amazon.com/dp/0534349749/>

The following data appears to be a survey of about 30 subjects asking them to rate a car (do they own it?) on a scale of 1-5 on various attributes:  "Exciting", "Dependable", "Luxurious", "Outdoorsy", "Powerful", "Stylish", "Comfortable", "Rugged", "Fun", "Safe", "Performance", "Family", "Versatile", "Sports", "Status", "Practical".

The cars were:  "BMW 328i","Ford Explorer","Infiniti J30","Jeep Grand Cherokee","Lexus ES300","Chrysler Town & Country", "Mercedes 280", "Saab 9000", "Porsche Boxter", "Volvo V90".

This dataset may likely have been the result of an MBA course (e.g., part of a survey methods course) that the author Lattin then included in his textbook.

The package maintainer of `humanVerseWSU` found it on the Internet, removed missing data, structured it as an `rds` dataframe for R, and included it herein.
